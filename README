User Management Overview
The user management system provides secure functionality for registration, login, logout, and password reset using a RESTful API and token-based authentication.

Registration
Users can register by submitting a unique username and password. The password is hashed before being stored in the database for security. If the username already exists, the server will reject the request.

Login
Users provide their username and password to authenticate. If the credentials are correct, the server generates a session token, which is stored in memory and returned to the client along with the user ID.

Logout
To log out, the client sends their user ID and token. The server validates the token and, if valid, removes the session data, effectively logging the user out.

Password Reset
Password reset is only allowed for logged-in users. The client must provide their session token, current password, and a new password. The server validates the session and the original password before securely updating the new hashed password in the database.
